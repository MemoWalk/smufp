The policies in the datasets are called differently than in the paper. The following mapping exists:

SNG => SUP-0
PCK => OOP-0
DRP => IZP-0
EXH => ODZ-0
SFF => SUP
PFF => OOP
DFF => IZP
EFF => ODZ

The files bySampleSizes.csv and byTimeHorizons.csv have been reported in the text.  The file MASTER.csv is the data that results from the paper itself and needs to be created by merging MASTER_1, MASTER_2, and MASTER_3.
